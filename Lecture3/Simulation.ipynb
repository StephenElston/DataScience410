    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation enables data scientists to study the behavior of stochastic processes with complex probability distributions. Simple processes might be approximated by a known, or 'named' distribution. In these simple cases, it might even be possible to derive analytical results. However, many real-world processes have complex behavior, resulting in complex distributions of output values. In these cases, simulation is a practical approach to understanding these processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "As cheap computational power has become ubiquitous, simulation has become a widely used technique in the data scientist's tool box. Simulations compute a large number of cases, or realizations, of the probability distribution of the process being studied. The final or posterior distribution of the process being simulated is comprised of these realizations. The computing cost of each realization must be low in any practical simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists use simulation for a number of purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation is used to test models. If data simulated from the model do not resemble the original data, something is likely wrong with the model.\n",
    "- Simulation is used to understand processes with complex probability distributions. In these cases, simulation provides a powerful and flexible computational technique to understand behavior.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Creating, testing and debugging simulation software can be tricky. Some of the techniques which can make your life easier are the same as you should use when developing any analytics software, or even software in general. But, given the stochastic nature of simulation, testing and debugging can be more difficult than other types of software. Some commonly employed techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build your simulation as a series of small, easily tested chunks In practice, this means you will build your simulation by creating and testing a set of small functions that comprise the overall model.\n",
    "- Test each small functional unit individually. These tests should include at least testing some typical cases, as well as boundary or extreme cases. Sensible behavior with extreme or limiting cases is a requirement for a stable simulation. Both tabular and graphical output can be useful for evaluating these tests.\n",
    "- Test your overall simulation each time you add a new functional component. This processes ensures that all the components work together. \n",
    "- Simulations are inherently stochastic. If you want to create identical numerical results, say for automated testing, set a seed before you begin tests. In this notebook no seed is set so you can experience the stochastic nature of the simulation. "

    "\n",
    "The notebook implements a simulation of the profitability of a sandwich shop. Not surprisingly, the sandwich shop earns money every time a customer buys a sandwich. However, the inputs to the sandwich cost money. The daily profit is the amount customers pay for the sandwiches minus the costs of the inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of bread is an input which is particularly difficult to manage. The shop bakes its own bread before the shop opens, and the bread must be used on the day it is made. The customers can select one of three types of bread, white, wheat, and multigrain. The customers are unusually picky. If the shop does not have bread of the customer's choice on hand, the customer will leave the shop without buying a sandwich. However, any extra bread left at the end of the day is discarded and the cost reduces the profitability of the shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the simulation simple, several assumptions are made:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability that each customer chooses a particular type of bread is stationary and known. These probabilities are 50% for white bread, 25% for wheat and 25% for multigrain. \n",
    "- If a customer's choice of bread is not available the customer leaves the shop without buying a sandwich.\n",
    "- The only perishable input which must be discarded at the end of each day is the bread. \n",
    "- Customers do not stop coming to the sandwich shop as a result of not finding their bread choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality these are questionable assumptions, and a real-world situation would be more complex. The simulation techniques we are about to use can be applied to much more complex situations. \n",
