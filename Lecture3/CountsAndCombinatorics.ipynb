    "Combinatorics of the largest areas of mathematics. We apply combinatorics to compute the possible combinations or permutations of an combination of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use combinatorics to compute the number of possible sandwiches we can order at a sandwich shop with a limited menu, 4 bread choices, 5 meat choices, 4 toppings.  How many sandwich unique sandwich combination can we order by picking only one item from each category?   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$4 * 5 * 4 = 80$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As, you can see, for this problem we just need to multiply the number of choices for each category. This is an example of the **multiplication principle** of combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example there is no dependency of our choice from one category to any other. Consequently, we can find all of the possible combinations by simple multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always the case. Let's look at an example where each event changes the subsequent possible events. Let's say you go to a pub and you want to order a 4-beer taster, with each beer being unique. The pub has 10 beers on tap. How many possible choices do you have for the taster? Fortunately you know `python`, so you can use the `python` `itertools.combinations` function to build a table of all possible combinations of my 4-beer taster!"
