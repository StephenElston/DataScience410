    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap and re-sampling methods are widely applicable statistical methods. Unlike the statistical methods we have encountered before, these methods are products of the computer age. By repeatedly re-sampling the data some of the assumptions of classical statistical methods can be relaxed. The trade-off is that re-sampling methods are computationally intensive.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Re-sampling methods draw heavily on the central limit theorem (CLT). The CLT ensure that re-sampled static estimates converge to the correct value, given the data sample.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically re-sampling methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow computation of statistics from limited data samples of large populations.\n",
    "- Compute statistics from multiple subsamples of dataset.\n",
    "- The result is the probability distribution of the statistic being computed.  \n",
    "- Make minimal distributional assumptions, when compared to classical frequentist statistics.\n",
    "- Are computationally intensive, but often highly parallelizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used re-sampling methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomization or Permutation methods: e.g. Fisher's exact test.\n",
    "- Bootstrap: re-sample with equivalent size and replacement.\n",
    "- Jackknife: leave one out re-sampling.\n",
    "- Cross validation: re-sample into multiple folds without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-sampling methods are general and powerful but, there is no magic involved! When using re-sampling methods always keep in mind these pitfalls:\n",
    "- If a sample is biased, the re-sampled statistic estimate based on that sample will be biased.\n",
    "- The sample variance and Cis can be no better than the data sample allows.\n",

    "## A Brief History of Re-sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomization and permutation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization and permutation methods were pioneered by Fisher as early as 1911. Fisher fully developed the theory in his 1935 book. Scalability of these permutation methods remain limited, even with modern computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, cross-validation is widely used in the testing of machine learning models. Cross-validation was originally proposed by Kurtz in 1948. Mosier extended the method to double cross validation in 1951. The modern method of nested or multicross-validation were introduced by Krus and Fuller in 1982. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jack knife methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack knife methods are often effective when there are only limited data samples. Maurice Quenouille originally suggested this method in 1949. The jack knife was fully developed\n",
    "by John W. Tukey, who gave the method its name, in 1958. Tukey saw that method as a simple tool useful for many purposes like a pocket knife. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrap \n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap is an extremely general and powerful re-sampling method. In principle, the bootstrap algorithm and can provide estimates of the distributions of most any statistic. The bootstrap method was first suggested by Efron and Hinkley in 1978 and further developed by Efron in 1979. A full treatment was provided in Efron's 1980 book. \n",

    "![](img/2014_Efron-outdoors.jpg)\n",

    "As with other re-sampling methods, the bootstrap algorithm is computationally intensive. However, with increased computing power, use of bootstrap methods continues to expand. Further, the algorithm can be readily parallelized.  "

    "## Point Estimates vs. Distribution Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of **frequentist statistics** is to compute a **point estimate** and **confidence interval** for the point estimate. By a point estimate, we mean a single most likely value for a statistic. The confidence interval is based on the properties of some assumed probability distribution of the statistic. Up to now we have worked with hypothesis tests and summary statistics computed with frequentist methods. For example, with the t-test we found the most likely value of the t-statistic and the confidence interval assuming the difference of means follows a t-distribution.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Are there alternative to this frequentist approach? Yes, indeed there are. The most widely used alternative are found in **Bayesian statistics**. In this lesson, we will focus on re-sampling methods, particularly **bootstrap** methods. The bootstrap lies somewhere between classical frequentist statistics and Bayesian methods.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than computing a point estimate directly, bootstrap methods compute a **bootstrap distribution** of the statistic. The bootstrap distribution is comprised of values of the statistic computed from **bootstrap samples** of the original data sample. Based on this distribution a mostly likely point estimate of the statistic, or **bootstrap estimate** (the mean of the distribution) is computed. The **bootstrap confidence interval** is also computed from the bootstrap distribution. This approach is in contrast to the purely frequentist approach of computing point estimates and confidence intervals using the original data sample. "

    "## Overview of the Bootstrap Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap method follows a simple algorithm. Estimates of the statistic are accumulated by these steps:    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly sample (e.g. Bernoulli sample) N data with replacement from an original data sample of N values. That is, the re-sample is the same size as the original data sample.   \n",
    "2. Re-compute the statistic with the current sample sample. This is a **bootstrap sample** of the statistic.   \n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to accumulate the required number of bootstrap samples. \n",
    "4. Accumulated statistic values form the **bootstrap distribution**. \n",
    "5. The mean of the computed statistic values is the **bootstrap point estimate** of the statistic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can compute the bootstrap mean as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Meanboot = \\frac{\\Sigma_i mean(sample_i)}{nsample}$$\n",
    "where, for example with 10 data values and example of the ith re-sample might be:\n",
    "$$sample_i = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 + X_6 + X_7 + X_8 + X_1 + X_5$$"

    "## Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross validation** is a **leave many out** re-sampling technique. Cross validation uses multiple non-overlapping subsamples, known as **folds**, to train and test a data set. THe basic cross validation algorithm uses the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide dataset into N randomly selected non-overlapping folds. \n",
    "2. Use N – 1 Folds train a machine learning model. \n",
    "3. Use the remaining fold to evaluate model performance.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, holding out a different fold each time. \n",
    "5. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics using the M results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of cross validation is illustrated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/CrossValidation.jpg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Model performance is evaluated using at aggregated summary statistics across the the trained models. Test data from each re-sample is used for the evaluation. The re-sampling reduces bias in the model performance statistics. Most importantly, cross validation reduces unpleasant surprises when a model is placed in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "The jack knife is an extreme end member of the family of cross validation methods. With the jack knife, the number of folds equals the number of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variations on cross validation. The most commonly used is **nested cross validation**. In nested cross validation, cross validation is performed for multiple models to compare performance. In this context, a model of the same class with different hyperparameters is a different model. \n",
