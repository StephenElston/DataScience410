    "- **Select a criteria to evaluate the hypothesis:** If our sample has a probability of $>= 90\\%$ chance that the increase could be caused by randomness alone we will reject the null hypthesis that the logo does not mater.\n",

    "Let's illustrate the use of an hypothesis test with an example.\n",

    "- We first state our population assumptions in the null hypothesis: $H_0$.\n",
    "- We state our new alternative hypothesis as an alternative to the null: $H_a$.\n",

    "  - $H_0 =$ The old website drives equal amount of traffic.\n",
    "  - $H_a =$ The old website drives less traffic than the new one.\n",
    "- Decide on a significance level (probability cutoff): 0.9, 0.95, and 0.99 are common (problem specific).\n",

    "Based on our findings we can only do two things\n",
    "- **Reject the null-hypothesis:** Since the alternative covers all other possibilities, we can say we accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Fail to reject the null hypothesis:**  We accept the null hypothesis because we have already believed our null hypothesis from the start. We can fail for two reasons:\n",
    "  - The alternative hypothesis was false to begin with.\n",

    "**Your turn:** It would be useful for the manager of the auto dealership understand which days of the week have significantly different average sales at the 95% confidence level. To solve this problem do the following:\n",
    "1. Compute and print the results of the Tukey HSD test using the `pairwise_tukeyhsd` function. To do so, you will need to first create a list of sales data by concatenating the sales by day of the week using the `numpy.concatenate` function, and then apply the `flatten` method. Since these values are Numpy arrays you cannot use the `+` operator for concatenation. You will also need a list of days of the week, which can be created using the normal multiplication, `*`, and concatenation, `+` operators. \n",
    "2. Use the `plot_simultneous` method on your model object to display the confidence intervals of the means. "

    "## Clasical Tests and Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increasing scale of data sets in the 21st Century, problems with the correct applicaton of classical tests have been amplified. The primary issue is with false positives, or **Type I errors**. This problem is known as the problem of **multiple comparisons** or **base rate fallacy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this problem lets look at a simple example. If we have 7 groups, there are 21 possible interactions between the groups. If we use a t-test with a significance level of 0.05, we expect there to be one false positive, even if the null hypothesis is true in all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "These problems grow as the number of groups grow. As an example, consider classifing several millions objects from images. \n",
    "\n",
    "When there are relatively few groups with a great many cases there is no problem. The test will have ample power.\n",
    "\n",
    "With large numbers of groups, there is a high probability of getting a false positive, or type I error, with ANOVA. Without any way to know which groups are different, it is nearly impossible to determine which group may or may not be different from the rest of the population. This is a manifestation of the base rate fallacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonfirroni correction  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several adjustments to the multiple comparisons problem have been proposed. In 1979 Holm published a method know as the **Bonfirroni correction**. The adjustment is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_b = \\frac{\\alpha}{m}\\\\\n",
    "with\\\\ \n",
    "m =\\ number\\ of\\ groups$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the Bonfirroni correction is the reduction in power as the  grows smaller. For big data problems with large numbers of groups, this issue can be especially serious. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence and credible intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to the base rate falacy problem is to use **confidence intervals**. For example, one can compute the confidence intervals of the distributions of differences of means between groups. We have just seen an example with Tukeys HSD method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of confidence intervals is quite straight forward, especailly when compared to p-values. If the confidence intervals for the difference in means do not overlap 0 the difference in means is significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence intervals can be adjusted analogously to the Bonfirroni correction. This process does not have the problem with the reduction in power.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another approach is to use the Bayesian **credible interval**. While the computation is different, the intrepretation is intuitive, and analogous to interpretation of confidence intervals. "

    "- Distribution comparison tests in the form of the K-S test. The null hypothesis is that the two distributions are the same. \n",
    "- Variance comparison test for multiple grouped in the form of ANOVA. The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in the variances of the samples and they are all from the same population. \n",
    "- The meaning of the p-value or significance level. A p-value is the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one in your sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
